> The English language can not fully capture the depth and complexity of my thoughts. So I'm incorporating Emoji into my speech to better express myself. Winky face.

I have been working with I.T. related ventures since I was in my preteens. It started with a love for video games, blossoming into a love for coding and supporting those ignorant of any knowledge I possess. I strive to give constant support, answer any questions, and do my best to develop a product to your exact likings.
